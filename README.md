# albers
A web page that auto-generates [Josef Albers](http://www.albersfoundation.org/resources/educators/)-inspired color swatches using all of the named CSS colors.

I also shows the colors actually used by name and hex value.

For a demo see [https://terrencedorsey.com/albers/albers.html](https://terrencedorsey.com/albers/albers.html).

Enjoy
